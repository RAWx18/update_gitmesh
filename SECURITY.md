# Security Policy

## Overview

GitMesh, as a project supported by the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust, maintains a comprehensive security program to protect our users, contributors, and the broader open-source community. We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure practices and transparent communication.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Primary Reporting Method

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it **privately and responsibly** using GitHub's security advisory system:

1. Navigate to the **Security** tab of this repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Complete the security advisory form with comprehensive details

### Alternative Reporting Channel

For urgent security matters or when GitHub's system is unavailable:

- **Email**: rawx18.dev@gmail.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] GitMesh Vulnerability Report
- **Response Time**: Initial acknowledgment within 24-48 hours

### Information to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

**Vulnerability Summary:**
- Clear description of the security issue
- Assessment of potential impact and severity
- Affected components or systems

**Technical Details:**
- Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Proof of Concept (PoC) code or demonstration (if available)
- Environment details (browser, OS, versions)
- Any attempted workarounds or mitigations

**Discovery Context:**
- How and when the vulnerability was discovered
- Whether you've shared this information elsewhere
- Your preferred timeline for disclosure

## Our Response Process

Upon receiving your security report, we will:

**Initial Response (24-48 hours):**
- Acknowledge receipt of your report
- Provide a tracking reference for communication
- Conduct preliminary assessment of the issue

**Investigation Phase (1-7 days):**
- Verify and reproduce the reported vulnerability
- Assess impact and determine severity level
- Coordinate with Linux Foundation security team if necessary

**Resolution Phase:**
- Develop and test security patches
- Prepare coordinated disclosure timeline
- Notify you of progress and expected resolution

**Disclosure:**
- Coordinate public disclosure after fixes are deployed
- Publish security advisory with appropriate attribution
- Recognize your contribution (with your permission)

## Security Scope

- Update dependencies promptly once fixes are available

## Response Expectations

### Timeline Guidelines

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- Initial response: Within 24 hours
- Investigation: 24-72 hours
- Fix development: 1-7 days
- Public disclosure: After patch deployment

**High Severity Issues:**
- Initial response: Within 48 hours
- Investigation: 2-5 business days
- Fix development: 1-14 days
- Public disclosure: 14-30 days post-fix

**Medium/Low Severity:**
- Initial response: Within 1 week
- Investigation: 1-2 weeks
- Fix inclusion: Next scheduled release
- Public disclosure: With release notes

### Communication Standards

We commit to:
- Regular updates on investigation progress
- Transparent communication about timelines
- Coordination on disclosure preferences
- Recognition of your contribution to project security

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

### What We Ask

**Please DO:**
- Report vulnerabilities through established channels
- Provide sufficient detail for reproduction and assessment
- Allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation
- Coordinate disclosure timing with our security team

**Please DO NOT:**
- Publicly disclose vulnerabilities before coordinated release
- Access or modify data beyond what's necessary for demonstration
- Perform destructive testing or service disruption
- Share vulnerability details with third parties without permission

### Safe Harbor Commitment

GitMesh commits to not pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Act in good faith to identify and report security issues
- Follow responsible disclosure practices outlined in this policy
- Avoid unnecessary data access or service disruption
- Respect user privacy and project intellectual property

## Recognition and Attribution

We value the security research community and offer:

**Public Recognition:**
- Credit in security advisories and release notes
- Listing in project contributors and security hall of fame
- Professional references for security research work

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
- Direct communication with development team
- Early access to beta releases for security testing
- Input on security feature development and architecture

## Limitations and Resources

### Resource Constraints

While we maintain high security standards, please understand:

- Response times may vary based on team availability and issue complexity
- Not all reported issues may qualify as security vulnerabilities
- Fix timelines depend on technical complexity and testing requirements
- Some issues may require coordination with external parties
