# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive refactoring of the Beetle application to address three critical architectural issues: frontend modularization, backend consolidation, and data integrity. The current system has a monolithic frontend hub component, mixed Python/JavaScript backend architecture, and relies on dummy data throughout the application. This refactor will transform Beetle into a clean, maintainable, and production-ready system while preserving all existing functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Hub Modularization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Beetle frontend, I want the monolithic hub component split into modular, reusable components so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows separation of concerns principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend hub is accessed THEN the system SHALL display the same content and functionality as the current monolithic implementation
2. WHEN navigating between overview, projects, activity, and insights pages THEN the system SHALL route correctly using proper React Router implementation
3. WHEN components are rendered THEN each component SHALL have a single responsibility and clear interface boundaries
4. WHEN the application loads THEN all existing animations, styling, and user interactions SHALL work identically to the current implementation
5. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the routing logic SHALL be based on intelligent analysis of component content and user flow patterns
6. WHEN components are split THEN no existing text, UX elements, or visual design SHALL be modified unless absolutely required for technical implementation

### Requirement 2: Backend Architecture Consolidation

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying Beetle, I want a single Python Django backend with Supabase database so that the infrastructure is simplified, maintainable, and follows modern best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use only Django as the backend framework with no JavaScript server components
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use Supabase as the primary database with proper connection pooling and error handling
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN all existing JavaScript backend routes SHALL be fully replicated in Django with identical functionality
4. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the OAuth flow SHALL work seamlessly with the new Django backend
5. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN real-time chat functionality SHALL work identically to the current implementation
6. WHEN file uploads are processed THEN the Django backend SHALL handle all file operations that were previously handled by the JavaScript backend
7. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the JavaScript backend server SHALL be completely removable without affecting functionality

### Requirement 3: Real Data Implementation

**User Story:** As a user of the Beetle application, I want to see only real data from actual sources so that the information displayed is accurate and actionable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is displayed in any component THEN the system SHALL show only real data fetched from actual APIs or databases
2. WHEN data fetching fails THEN the system SHALL display clear, user-friendly error messages explaining what went wrong
3. WHEN dummy data is encountered during refactoring THEN it SHALL be completely removed and replaced with real data sources or error handling
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN proper error boundaries SHALL catch and handle failures gracefully
5. WHEN loading states occur THEN users SHALL see appropriate loading indicators while real data is being fetched
6. WHEN no data is available THEN the system SHALL show empty states with helpful messaging rather than dummy content

### Requirement 4: System Reliability and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer working on Beetle, I want the refactored system to be reliable and maintainable so that future development is efficient and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is performed THEN the system SHALL remain functional at all times during the migration process
2. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow separation of concerns with clear presentation, logic, and data layers
3. WHEN changes are made THEN they SHALL be minimal and safe rather than risky rewrites
4. WHEN architecture decisions are made THEN they SHALL prioritize clean, maintainable code over quick fixes
5. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the system SHALL be scalable and prepared for future feature development
6. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL clearly explain the new architecture and any assumptions made during development

### Requirement 5: Data Layer Architecture

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a clean data layer architecture so that data access is consistent, secure, and performant across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database models are created THEN they SHALL use Django ORM with proper relationships and constraints
2. WHEN Supabase is integrated THEN connection management SHALL be robust with proper error handling and connection pooling
3. WHEN data access occurs THEN it SHALL go through well-defined service layers rather than direct database access in views
4. WHEN migrations are run THEN they SHALL preserve existing data and maintain referential integrity
5. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance and include proper indexing strategies

### Requirement 6: API Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the API endpoints to remain compatible during the backend migration so that frontend functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are migrated THEN they SHALL maintain identical request/response formats to the JavaScript backend
2. WHEN authentication tokens are used THEN they SHALL work seamlessly across the migration
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL provide the same real-time functionality as before
4. WHEN file uploads occur THEN they SHALL be processed with the same capabilities as the JavaScript backend
5. WHEN error responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow the same format and status codes as the original implementation
